# YeeLight Integration

I don't know if the correct is send the .venv to github too, but I started this project a long time ago, I'm just finishing some old projects, now I can control the bulb with my terminal.<br>

If you want to read the documentation of the python-yeelight library you can do it [here](https://yeelight.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)<br>
And the integration operations specifications [here](https://www.yeelight.com/download/Yeelight_Inter-Operation_Spec.pdf)
